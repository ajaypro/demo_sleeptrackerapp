TrackMySleepQuality - Starter Code
==================================

Starter code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelab 6.1 Room

Introduction
------------

TrackMySleepQuality is an app for recording sleep data for each night. 
You can record a start and stop time, assign a quality rating, and clear the database. 

In this codelab, working from this starter app,
you will implement the Room database that holds the sleep data. 
You will then use instrumented tests to verify that this backend works. 


Things to Learn
--------------

Using ListAdapter: 

* We use list adapter which takes Data, VH as type and diffutil as constructor argument.
    Uses diffutil which further is implemented by asyncListDiffer which runs in bg thread to provide 
    difference in list 
  * Also internally implements `getItem()` and `getItemCount()`, we don't need to call in adapter
  * AsyncListDiffer a helper for computing differences between two lists with on DiffUtil and runs on bg thread
  
  Data binding:
  
 * Binding adapters are a good solution when you need to transform complex data.
 * `binding.executePendingBindings()` This call is an optimization that asks data binding to execute any pending bindings right away. 
    It's always a good idea to call `executePendingBindings()` when you use binding adapters in a RecyclerView, 
	because it can slightly speed up sizing the views.
